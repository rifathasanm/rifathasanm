       <p> Cricket is my favorite hobby and a famous sport too. It makes me feel healthy, fit and a stronger person. It makes me feel confident and proud of what I am. I started playing cricket when I was a kid of 7 years old.My cricket passion started when I was a small kid and I started playing this game with my elder brother in the back side of my home.</p>
    <p>                  BADMINTON         </p>
       <p> Badminton is a great sport to start because it is easy to play, fun, and inexpensive. It is one of the faster and most addictive racquet sports out there. Whether you are interested in getting serious about your play and competing in tournaments or just want to play it in the park on a Sunday with friends I know you will like it allot!

    <h2>Achievements</h2>
    <p>My greatest achievement so far is that I've been able to continue with my normal life. I love what I do, but more so, I'm glad to have people who care about me close by.</p>
   
    <h2>Future plan and purpose</h2>
    <p>The future is never just one choice. It's a thousand. And they never stop. You will choose your future every day of your life. And should you wake up one day to find that you regret the choice you made the day before, then make a new one. Don't worry about whether you might be wrong someday. Worry about whether you're right now. Tomorrow can wait.</p>
